Hello I am Kadir Batuhan Demir.
I entered the Monovi Winter Camp and become and  Incudemist.
They give us a homework. It was  a Stock Warehouse System.


We act like we were a little Migros Warehouse.
We made a scenerio for the processes and made plans.
We prepared drafts for documents.
Register, Shipment and Waybill(irsaliye)

We design the Warehouse and create BIN Numbers,
create manufacturer codes.

Also we planned a database and create an Analysis Document
with make ups.

I was the Scrum Master but I helped so much things.
I done final version of documents and manufacturer codes.
I create the most of the database on SQL
I helped every Mock_up designs on Balsamiq.

In this project I learned the importance of group working
and learned how to create a Real-Life Business Analysis Report.
Also group  working was difficult because we made it in our free
times.But we got it done and succeed in our Document.
